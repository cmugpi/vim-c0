# vim-c0

A Vim plugin for getting C0 syntax highlighting in Vim.

I did not write this code. It is commonly distributed unlicensed at CMU.

## Installation

Use your favorite plugin manager. If you don't have one, I'd recommend Vundle,
though you should probably also take a look at Pathogen, as it's more common.

```
# if your ~/.vim folder isn't under source control:
git clone https://github.com/cmugpi/vim-c0 ~/.vim/bundle/

# if your ~/.vim folder is under source control:
git submodule add https://github.com/cmugpi/vim-c0 ~/.vim/bundle/
```
